        <!-- Questions to ask each week:
        
        When and why was this archive created? (Pre-research on Wikipedia)
        Where did the objects come from?
        Under what circumstances were they acquired?
        Who is the archive made for?
        What are visitors expected to know?
        What are they expected to do, think and feel?
        What are the 'conditions of possibility' for this archive to exist?
        Do you think this has been put together by a small team, maybe even a team of volunteers? 
        Or a global corporation? An empire?
        How does the website embody and express these conditions of possibility?
        What taxonomies (categories and tags) do they use to organise their collections?
        What metadata do they employ and display?
        Is the archive made for your visit?
        What third-party platforms are they using?

<p>When it was established in 1753 The British Museum became the first public national museum in the world. Over 250 hundred years later it has emmassed a collection of nearly eight million works making it one of the largest in the world.</p>

<p> Emily Duthie remarks in her article for <a href="https://epress.lib.uts.edu.au/journals/index.php/phrj/article/view/1523">Public History Review</a>, "museum building in Britain in the nineteenth century was a direct consequence of war, colonialism and missionary expeditions". The British Museum is the embodiment of this colonial legacy, with the size of its collection oweing much to the expanse of the British Empire. Knowing this makes it hard for the visitor shake the feeling that the items being observed have been misappropriated. That their native homes may never see them again, even if they make international pleas for their return as is the case with the Rosetta Stone and Elgin Marbles.</p>

<p>Not all of the collection was acquired in this way, however. Items were donated for the purpose of preservation, loaned from other institutions or purchased using the British Museum's considerable budget. These items are all on display too, however identifying them is not an easy task.

<p>Given the scale of the collection it is evident that a large team was employed to digitise it. The search engine is quick and allows the visitor to filter their results through multiple other dimensions â€“ a necessary feature when you a single keyword can return tens of thousands of results. The objects themselves include a comprehensive amount of meta data to aid understanding, and in many cases this meta data is also hyperlinked to other items of matching properties creating a pleasing taxonomy.</p>

<p>It was widely reported that Google was working alongside the British Museum to help people explore their collection. Whether they worked on the core website is unclear, however they were directly involved in the creation of the sister website <a href="https://britishmuseum.withgoogle.com/">The Museum of the World'</a> and also the <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.5191723,-0.1274555,2a,75y,249.32h,69.89t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sX0UyMF2bByFBzUSUIxm3mA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en">Google Street View interactive tour</a>. Evidently the British Museum has had significant technological backing to bring its collection online.</p>

<p>Along with Google Maps the museum makes use of many other third-party services. You are able to view objects in more detail using the Sketchfab plugin, like this one of the <a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/the-rosetta-stone-1e03509704a3490e99a173e53b93e282">Rosetta Stone</a> alongside access audio tours with the use of Soundcloud.</p>
