        <header><h1>A visit to Google Arts and Culture</h1></header>

        <p>When carrying out these field trips we are given a list of questions to consider when visiting the website. Typically one question intrigues me the most and I end up spending most of my time on that. In the case of the <a href="wk1-bm.html">British Museum</a> it was, "where did these objects comes from? And under what circumstances were they acquired?"</p>

        <p>This question is similarly interesting when considering <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com">Google Arts and Culture</a>, however there is one other that stuck in my mind this week:</p>

        <p><em>Why was this archive created?</em></p>

        <p>It's a great question, why does one of the world's largest advertising companies want to create Google Arts and Culture? I can offer four ideas.</p>

        <p>First, by encouraging partner museums to cooperate with Google on this project they gain access to that institution's data. Data is the life blood of Google's various commercial enterprises. By digitising the museum's collection, complete with high resolution images and associated meta data, they are able to improve Google's internal knowledge graph and machine learning algorithms. Similarly, by creating detailed 3D maps of the museum's physical space, they are able to improve the quality of Google's commercial mapping product, Google Maps.</p>

        <p>Second, by supporting cultural institutions Google maintains a long tradition of patronage of the arts by private companies. The reasons company's conduct this sort of activity is varied, however one summary is that patronising the arts creates a type of soft power that private companies can leverage in the future. What is particularly unique about this example of soft power accumulation is that it is carried out so overtly. This is not a donation that leads to the creation of a museum wing or exhibition acknowledgement, it is an fairly transparent attempt to associate many of the world's finest examples of art under the Google brand.</p>

        <p>Third, Google is able to able to use the project to experiment with new forms of technology that will drive commercial value down the line. Google Arts and Culture allows Google to perfect new techniques, such as indoor mapping and AR vision, while simultaneously introducing these concepts to websites viewers and learning from their interactions.</p>

        <p>I find my fourth argument most compelling however.</p>

        <p>There is a trope from the world of tech startups, one that is often said with a substantial amount of pride, that goes a little like this. The world's largest taxi company doesn't own any cabs. The world's largest hotel operator doesn't own any buildings. And the world's largest media company doesn't employ any journalists.</p>

        <p>This is, of course, a reference to the growth of platform businesses, companies who do not own much physical capital, and instead capture values by owning the digital space in which buyers and sellers of these services meet.</p>

        <p>This strikes me as a good way to conceptualise <em>why</em> Google has created Arts and Culture. They aim to create value for themselves by aggregating museum content and ultimately creating the dominant digital space in which this type of content is consumed.</p>

        <p>It may well be a long time until Google Arts and Culture can join the likes of Uber, Airbnb and Facebook as &quot;the world's largest museum that doesn't own any objects&quot; but it is presumably a goal to which they aspire.</p>
