            <header><h1>A visit to The British Museum Website</h1></header>

            <p>When it was established in 1753 The British Museum became the first public national museum in the world. Over 250 hundred years later it has amassed a collection of nearly eight million works making it one of the largest in the world.</p>

            <p>Emily Duthie remarks in her article for <a href="https://epress.lib.uts.edu.au/journals/index.php/phrj/article/view/1523">Public History Review</a>, "museum building in Britain in the nineteenth century was a direct consequence of war, colonialism and missionary expeditions". The British Museum is the embodiment of this colonial legacy, with the size of its collection owing much to the expanse of the British Empire. Knowing this makes it hard for the visitor shake the feeling that the items being observed have been misappropriated; that their native homes may never see them again, even if they make international pleas for their return as is the case with the Rosetta Stone and Elgin Marbles.</p>

            <p>Not all of the collection was acquired in this way, however. Items were donated for the purpose of preservation, loaned from other institutions or purchased using the British Museum's considerable budget. These items are all on display too, however, identifying them is not an easy task. This is all the more frustrating when you consider the museum's significant investment in metadata. Take for example the <a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/Y_EA24" target="_blank">Rosetta Stone</a>, or object EA24 as it is also known. This single piece has 26 types of metadata, many of which contain multiple attributes. Furthermore much of the metadata is hyperlinked, allowing the visitor to easily access pieces that are connected by place, time, creator and other common features. Given that this effort has been repeated over eight million times you can quickly establish the size of the team required to digitise it.</p>

            <p>It was widely reported that Google was working alongside the British Museum to help people explore their collection. Whether they worked on the core website is unclear, however they were directly involved in the creation of the sister website <a href="https://britishmuseum.withgoogle.com/">The Museum of the World'</a> and also the <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.5191723,-0.1274555,2a,75y,249.32h,69.89t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sX0UyMF2bByFBzUSUIxm3mA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en">Google Street View interactive tour</a>. Evidently the British Museum has had significant technological backing to bring its collection online.</p>

            <p>Along with Google Maps the museum makes use of many other third-party services. You are able to view objects in more detail using the Sketchfab plugin, like this one of the <a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/the-rosetta-stone-1e03509704a3490e99a173e53b93e282">Rosetta Stone</a> and access audio tours with the use of Soundcloud.</p>

            <p>While my knowledge of museum websites is limited I would hazard a guess that few offer as comprehensive a tour of human history as the British Museum. However understanding <em>how</em> the institution was able to achieve it's impressive scope leaves more than a bitter aftertaste in the mouth.</p>
