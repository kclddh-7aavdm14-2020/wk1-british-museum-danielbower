    </header>

    <p>Hello everyone!</p>
        
    <p>My name is Daniel Bower (Dan) and I previously studied at the University of Manchester doing an undergraduate degree in Politics and Economics. However I graduated in 2006 so I think that makes me a mature student!</p>

    <p>I did some "bedroom coding" when I was younger but haven't done any since then despite working quite close to software engineers during my career. I am excited about the opportunity to do some coding again.</p>
        
    <p>I am a big fan of photography, so love museums/galleries that are dedicated to photos. I recently got back from Puglia and saw a fantastic exhibition of Gianni Berengo Gardin whose photos of Italy in the 50s and 60s are particularly wonderful. The exhibition was in <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=otranto+castle&t=osx&iax=images&ia=images" title="Images of Otranto Castle in Puglia">Otranto Castle</a> which made for a great setting, but I haven't been able to find a link to share with you all so <a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/search/pins/?q=Gianni%20Berengo%20Gardin%2050s&rs=typed" title="Photos taken by Gianni Berengo Gardi" target="_blank"> here is an image search result</a> to give you a sense of it.</p>
        
    <p>I'll leave you all with a list of my five favourite museums!
